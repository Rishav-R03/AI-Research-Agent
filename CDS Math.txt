It's tricky to definitively sort topics by "difficulty" as it's subjective and depends on an individual's prior mathematical background and aptitude. However, I can categorize the chapters into common mathematical branches and then offer a general perception of difficulty, keeping in mind that some topics within a category might be harder than others.

Here's a categorization and a suggested difficulty sorting for the CDS Mathematics syllabus:

I. Arithmetic

Number System
Sequence and Series
HCF and LCM of Numbers
Decimal Fractions
Square Roots and Cube Roots
Percentage
Simple Interest
Compound Interest
Profit and Loss
Ratio and Proportion
II. Algebra

Logarithm
Algebraic Operations
HCF and LCM of Polynomials
Rational Expressions
Linear Equations
Quadratic Equations and Inequalities
Set Theory
III. Commercial/Applied Mathematics

Time and Distance
Time and Work
IV. Geometry & Trigonometry

Measurements of Angles and Trigonometric Ratios
Height and Distance
Lines and Angles
